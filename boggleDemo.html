			Hi, I'm Fiona Gillespie and this is a Boggle program I created using Java. I used PApplet for the UI and the Collins Dictionary to decide what counts as a word. <br><br>

			Each die in my program has the same 6 letters that you would find on a physical Boggle die. I copied over the letters from my family's Boggle game so the boards would be as realistic as possible. <br><br>

			From the board, I use a depth first search to find all the possible words. My algorithm also checks to see if each prefix is in the dictionary before continuining to find extensions of that prefix. <br><br>

			The demo shows how the board can be rotated in a counter-clockwise direction, how the word list can be shown, and how to start a new round. The word list only shows words of a certain minimum length. In this case, the words must be at least 4 letters long, as that is the rule my family plays with. <br><br>

			My Boggle Github repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/fgillespie66/Boggle">here</a>.
			I am currently working on hosting my Boggle game through Digital Ocean. Check back soon to play!
